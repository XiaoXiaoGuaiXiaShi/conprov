# conprov

The system consists of conprov and provData. conprov is used to generate the log of the specified container, and provData is responsible for preprocessing the log data and generating the provenance graph. Therefore, we need to run a docker container firstly, and then run conprov to monitor this specified container, and copy the generated log path to provData for processing. The libraries needed to run the system have been installed in the virtual machine. To verify the functionality of the system, follow these steps:

1. docker pull training/webapp
2. docker run -d -P training/webapp python app.py
3. docker inspect 
3. cd conprov && make all
2.
