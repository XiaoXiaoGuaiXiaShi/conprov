# conprov

The system consists of conprov and provData. conprov is used to generate the log of the specified container, and provData is responsible for preprocessing the log data and generating the provenance graph. Therefore, we need to run a docker container firstly, and then run conprov to monitor this specified container, and copy the generated log path to provData for processing. The libraries needed to run the system have been installed in the virtual machine. To verify the functionality of the system, follow these steps:

1. docker pull training/webapp
2. docker run --name test -d -P training/webapp python app.py
3. copy the Id : docker inspect (test) |grep Id
4. cd conprov && make all
5. ./conprovd (you need input the Id)
6. When you access the container's web service or interact with it via a bash session, relevant activities will be recorded. 
7. You can stop monitoring the container by pressing Ctrl+C. The log files will be stored in the `conprov` directory. Next, you can copy the log file to the `provData` folder and rename it to `conprov.log`.
6. cd ../provData
7. python3 spade_graph.py
